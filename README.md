# Heats of Formation from QM9

Jupyter Notebook to add the heats of formation of QM9 molecules to the dataset.

This notebook calculates the Heat of Formation for each molecule in the QM9 dataset and returns a CSV file of the dataset with the counts of the C, H, O, N, and F and the Heats of Formation.
